# Tips and Tricks

Understanding these concepts will help you get the most out of PearAI.

- **Be specific**.
  When you ask for, e.g., code changes, include concrete names and describe the desired outcome. Avoid vague references.
- **Provide context**.
  You can include the programming language ("in Rust") or other relevant contexts for basic questions.
  You can select a meaningful code snippet for code explanations and error diagnosis.
- **Do not trust answers blindly**.
- **Use different chat threads for different topics**.
  Shorter threads with specific topics will help PearAI respond more accurately.

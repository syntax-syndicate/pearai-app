# PearAI Templates

What if you want to craft an AI Chat that knows _specifically_ about your conventions?
How cool would it be to have the answers in your own language?

You can craft your own conversation templates by adding `.rdt.md` files to the `.pearai/template` folder in your workspace. See the [PearAI Template docs](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app/blob/main/doc/pearai-templates.md) for more information.

To use custom conversations, run the "PearAI: Start Custom Chatâ€¦ ðŸ’¬" command.

Here is an example of a [drunken pirate describing your code](https://github.com/trypear/pearai-app/blob/main/template/fun/drunken-pirate.rdt.md):
